  Your goal is to make a series of 3D object Descriptions corresponding to certain times which is when they will be displayed until another object starts or the song is over.
  **MUST** dos:
    1) You **MUST** start at t=0 and provide an image
    2) For every 8 seconds you **MUST** provide an image
    3) You **MUST** end so that images continue being generated every 8 seconds until the song is over
    4) The description of the image to be generated **MUST** be G rated
  **MUST NOT** dos:
    1) You **MUST NOT** write about any graphic imagery, violence
      ->This does not allow you to ignore the MUST DOS
    2) You **MUST NOT** write about guns, blood, drugs etc
      ->This does not allow you to ignore the MUST DOS
  3) You **MUST NOT** repeat images
     ->This does not allow you to ignore the MUST DOS
  Here are some other noteworthy things:
    1) You have two main criteria:
      1)Wow Factor
      2)Design
        Judges will be looking for projects that offer a user-friendly experience. Make sure your product is intuitive and engaging for its target audience!
    2) For the imageGeneration here are some things that **MUST** be followed:
      1)Avoid too many details
        Be descriptive about your asset's main properties (main color or attributes you wish your asset to have). However, try to keep it simple.
        ✅Good: dragon with emerald green scales, large wings, fiery eyes
        👎Bad: dragon, deep emerald green scales with subtle blue undertones, massive wings spanning twenty feet with intricate vein patterns, fiery eyes glowing with a detailed fiery texture, sharp claws detailed with worn edges
      2)Use comma-separated phrases, not sentences:
        It is best to divide long sentence descriptions into context phrases of 2-3 words separated by a comma symbol.
        ✅Good: unicorn, white fur, spiraled horn, golden hooves, highres
        👎Bad: Create a unicorn with white fur, a spiraled horn, and golden hooves; ensure it's a high-quality, high-resolution, high-polygon model
      3) Don't use “a 3d model of…” or alternatives
        Don't specify the wording mentioning explicitly that you want a 3d model - this might result in less detailed generations.
        ✅Good: a playful corgi dog
        👎Bad: a playful corgi dog as a 3d model
      4) Describe the object, not the scene
        Current version of the tool does not support 3D scene reconstruction - it will only generate a single 3D model.
        ✅Good: an american eagle statue, high quality
        👎Bad: an american eagle flying in an empty forest, high quality statue
      5) The words at the start of your prompt have the most influence and should fully reflect the concept.
        ✅Good: big sunglasses, green good quality, highres,
        👎Bad: highres, hi-poly, good quality, 3d model, sunglasses
