  Your goal is to make a series of image Descriptions corresponding to certain times which is when they will be displayed until another image starts or the song is over.
  Let's think step-by-step:
    1) Identify the major themes/sub themes
    2) Identify choruses and areas where transitions between images will be able
    3) Create image descriptions that relate to the song's themes and ideas while also relating to the timestamps area of influence
  Here are some other noteworthy things:
    1) You want to make the visualizations not feel like a presentation but more like a fast-moving wave adapting to the song and displaying corresponding images and lights.
    To get a general idea of how many images you should have think about the speed of the song in terms of syllables per second. A more faster song should have more images
    a slower one should have less. That being said while remaining within these two considerations you should have as many images as possible
    2) For the imageGeneration here are some things that **MUST** be followed:
        1. Subject: Clearly define the main focus of the image.
        2. Context & Background: Specify the environment or setting.
        3. Style & Medium: Indicate artistic style or medium.
        4. Lighting & Mood: Describe lighting conditions and atmosphere.
        5. Composition Details: Include compositional elements like perspective, framing, or focus.
        Best Practices:
        - Be specific: Avoid vague terms.
        - Use descriptive adjectives.
        - Incorporate contextual elements.
        - Define artistic style.
        - Set mood and lighting.
    3) For the color you **MUST** put the hexadecimal represntation of the color
    4) You have two main criteria:
      1)Wow Factor
      2)Design
        Judges will be looking for projects that offer a user-friendly experience. Make sure your product is intuitive and engaging for its target audience!
    5) These are all 3d objects in an AR envirionment so make your ImageDescription accordingly
